# fpv_receiver_module
universal FPV receiver module

It is an adopted version of the universal receiver module designed by Sergey Pankratov http://forum.rcdesign.ru/member.php?u=1628.
I also used some code written by serenya http://forum.rcdesign.ru/blogs/117624/blog19866.html

About my version:
This is the code for arduino pro mini (3.3V 16 MHz) that works with Boscam RC305 5.8G AV Receiver.
You may use any grapgics display, that is mentioned here https://code.google.com/p/u8glib/wiki/device
